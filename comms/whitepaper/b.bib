It takes as input models written in an extension of the Lustre language that allows the specification of assume-guarantee-style contracts for system components. Kind 2 was implemented from scratch based on techniques used by its predecessor, the PKind model checker. This paper discusses a number of improvements over PKind in terms of invariant generation. It also introduces two main features: contract-based compositional reasoning and certificate generation.",

  abstract = {Many techniques for verifying properties of continuous-time systems are limited to systems of moderate size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on assume-guarantee contracts and compositional reasoning for verifying properties of a broad class of continuous-time systems consisting of interconnected components. The notion of assume-guarantee contracts makes it possible to divide responsibilities among the system components: a contract specifies the property that a component must fulfill under some assumptions on the behavior of its environment (i.e. of the other components). We define weak and strong semantics of assume-guarantee contracts. We then establish a certain number of results for compositional reasoning, which allow us to show that a global assume-guarantee contract of the whole system is satisfied when all components satisfy their own contracts. We show that the weak satisfaction of the contract is sufficient to deal with interconnections described by a directed acyclic graph, while strong satisfaction is needed to reason about general interconnections containing cycles. Specific results for systems described by differential inclusions and invariance assume-guarantee contracts are then developed. Finally, we show how the proposed assume-guarantee framework can recast different versions of the small-gain theorem as a particular case. Throughout the paper, the main results are illustrated using simple examples.}

  abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both Büchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (Π11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.}
