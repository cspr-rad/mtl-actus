** Who is the audience?
*** If we prioritize the FV audience:
- "they sit down for two hours to read this and take away exciting ideas with their own thoughts"
*** ideally: we'd have like two audiences: econ and FV.
- walk through PAM and the vision for verifiable contracts as ELI5
- walk through automata, model checking ELI5
*** Impact story:
1. recruit talent in FV to work on financial verification on a public goods basis
  - motivates proof engineers and so on to contribute to verification frameworks /for product endpoints/ along the lines of the ACTUS Foundation's mandate
  - More succinctly: bringing FV people to the ACTUS table.
2. inspire financial leadership (including ACTUS leadership but not limited to) to support FV work.
3. R&D teams at commercial banks get inspired and ape our shit
4. Web3 audience builds web3 products with ACTUS

*Takeaway*: we are going to focus on *1* and *3*.
** Venue (or at least targeted to be to the standards of):
1. It's good to target a standard of quality, format, structure
  - some discovery to think of what venues have formats and structures that are appropriate
2. alt: the other reference class totally different is web3 whitepapers.
  - I don't think we like this vibe
  - This audience is secondary
** 1: Paper structure
*** Introduction
**** problem statement
**** contributions
Avi's take: start formalizing a basis for something that looks like ACTUS.
Matt's take:
- applying model checking to a fairly new domain (finance)
- contributes to the discourse of whether or not ACTUS is a formally verifiable spec
  - *by revealing* that ACTUS isn't formally verifiable
*** prior work
