#+title: Tactics

* Notes Jun26 call w Matt, Avi, Mark
** Timeline:
End of Q3
** Reviewers
*** authors:
- Quinn: first
- Matt: Assistance with programming
- Mark: leadership/oversight
*** alpha (internal)
- Una: Does a copy-editing pass mean authorship?
- Ed?
- Avi
- Marijan
*** beta (external)
- Zacharya
- Yves Hauser
- Mo
- Morgan
- kind2 guys
- EPFL/ETH folks from January
- Anthony Hart
** Who is the audience?
*** If we prioritize the FV audience:
- "they sit down for two hours to read this and take away exciting ideas with their own thoughts"
*** ideally: we'd have like two audiences: econ and FV.
- walk through PAM and the vision for verifiable contracts as ELI5
- walk through automata, model checking ELI5
*** Impact story:
1. recruit talent in FV to work on financial verification on a public goods basis
  - motivates proof engineers and so on to contribute to verification frameworks /for product endpoints/ along the lines of the ACTUS Foundation's mandate
  - More succinctly: bringing FV people to the ACTUS table.
2. inspire financial leadership (including ACTUS leadership but not limited to) to support FV work.
3. R&D teams at commercial banks get inspired and ape our shit
4. Web3 audience builds web3 products with ACTUS

*Takeaway*: we are going to focus on *1* and *3*.
** Venue (or at least targeted to be to the standards of):
1. It's good to target a standard of quality, format, structure
  - some discovery to think of what venues have formats and structures that are appropriate
2. alt: the other reference class totally different is web3 whitepapers.
  - I don't think we like this vibe
  - This audience is secondary
** 1: Paper structure
*** Introduction
**** problem statement
**** contributions
Avi's take: start formalizing a basis for something that looks like ACTUS.
Matt's take:
- applying model checking to a fairly new domain (finance)
- contributes to the discourse of whether or not ACTUS is a formally verifiable spec
  - *by revealing* that ACTUS isn't formally verifiable
*** prior work
*** (body) problem statement (Avi)
- money

*** future work

Paper review feedback:

+Don't forget to add a README and a link to the published paper.+
In the Abstract:
+The second and third sentence read awkward. I would go with something like "Complicated interactions between these parties could lead to misinterpretations and errors, an error while executing these interactions could lead to financial damage for the involved parties, which is obviously undesireable."+
+The code is available at the https url https://github.com/cspr-rad/mtl-actus.+
In the Introduction
+Add a short explanation what the limitiations of the current ACTUS approach are (if you think that is appropriate, I would be curious as a first time reader)+
Prior Work - 2.3 B-Method: citation is broken.
3.2 MTL
+I feel like 1-2 sentences are missing motivating the proposition code+
+3.3 Automata - 1-2 sentences for the code, what the respective attributes of the types represent. e.g. what are resets for transitions.+
+3.4.1 The first sentence needs to be rewritten I think.+
3.4.1 In the ip_continuous_till_mat code the box (always) is not rendered properly
Havent looked for punctuation or grammar.
