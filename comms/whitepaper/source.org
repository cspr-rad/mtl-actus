#+BEGIN_abstract
A financial contract is an interaction between people involving money. It is bad when there are bugs in the code executing these interactions. Additionally, it's not great when the interactions become too complicated to understand. Previously, the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS) [cite@Brammertz2019SmartCD] attempted to tackle this twin problem by rendering interactions as atomic state machines that compose together. In this paper, we take a natural next step to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) and take a contract to be an MTL /specification/, showing the proof of concept on the principal at maturity loan (PAM). Along the way, we implement MTL in the Lean prover. The code is available at the https url https://github.com/cspr-rad/mtl-actus.

* Introduction
Financial contracts, at their core, are interactions between people involving money. However, the execution of these interactions is increasingly reliant on code, which introduces the risk of bugs - a problem that has led to significant financial losses. Moreover, as financial instruments become more exotic, they often become too complex to interpret easily, further complicating the situation.

The Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS) is an attempt to address this dual challenge. It aimed to simplify financial interactions by representing them as atomic state machines that could be composed together. However, this approach, while innovative, had its limitations.

We propose a step forward by leveraging ideas from the field of model checking. Specifically, we suggest using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) as a foundation for defining financial contracts. In this framework, a contract becomes an MTL specification. This approach offers two key advantages: firstly, MTL specifications can serve as an interpretable grounding for even the most complex financial instruments. Secondly, contracts can be rigorously checked to ensure they comply with these MTL specifications.
This methodology has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and interpretability of financial contracts, addressing the core issues that have plagued the industry.

** Contributions
The current paper shows in principle how to model finance as a reactive system for the purposes of formal verification, on an example Principal at Maturity (PAM) contract.

1. Reactive System Approach: We demonstrate how financial contracts can be modeled as reactive systems, a paradigm commonly used in computer science for systems that maintain ongoing interactions with their environment. This novel perspective allows us to apply well-established formal verification techniques from the realm of reactive systems to financial contracts.
2. Formal Verification Framework: We introduce a framework for the formal verification of financial contracts. This approach enables rigorous mathematical proof of contract properties, potentially reducing errors and ambiguities in contract execution.
3. Principal at Maturity (PAM) Case Study: To illustrate our methodology, we provide a detailed case study of a Principal at Maturity (PAM) contract. This common financial instrument serves as an accessible yet meaningful example to showcase the power and applicability of our approach.
4. Temporal Logic Specification: We demonstrate how to express financial contract terms and conditions using MTL. This formal language allows for precise and unambiguous specification of time-dependent behaviors, which are crucial in financial contracts.
* Prior Work
** Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard
In [cite:@Brammertz2019SmartCD], the ACTUS (Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard) introduces a formalized approach to representing financial contracts using concepts from state machine theory. Developed by the ACTUS Financial Research Foundation, this framework models financial instruments as algorithmic contracts with well-defined states, events, and transition functions.

A key contribution of ACTUS is its event-based architecture for financial modeling. Each contract type is defined by a set of state variables and a series of event types. These events trigger state transitions and cash flows according to precisely specified functions. This approach allows for a representation of financial contracts over their lifecycle, enabling accurate projection of future states and cash flows.

ACTUS formalizes the temporal aspects of financial contracts through standardized scheduling functions and date adjustment conventions. This allows for precise modeling of complex temporal patterns in financial agreements, such as irregular payment schedules or conditional events.

By applying state machine concepts to finance, ACTUS provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for representing and analyzing financial contracts. This standardization facilitates more precise financial modeling, risk assessment, and regulatory analysis across a wide range of financial instruments.

** Algebraic and Inductively Defined Financial Interaction
[cite:@Jones2000ComposingCA] defined an algebra for contracts of two parties. In [cite:@Bahr2015CertifiedSM] a contract for more than two parties can be well-typed. This line of work is an alternative solution to the ACTUS-like solution, namely the typechecker, to a very similar problem set around correctness and interpretability of finance.

The seminal work on formalizing financial contracts using functional programming techniques was done by [cite:@Jones2000ComposingCA]. They introduced a combinator library for describing contracts declaratively, along with a compositional denotational semantics for valuing contracts. Their approach allowed complex contracts to be built up from simpler components in a modular way. Importantly, they separated the abstract specification of contracts from the concrete implementation details of valuation. This allowed different valuation models and numerical methods to be used without changing the contract descriptions.

Building on this foundation, [cite:@Bahr2015CertifiedSM] developed a certified symbolic management system for multi-party financial contracts. They extended the contract language to handle multiple parties and added a formal cash-flow semantics. Crucially, they implemented the contract language and management functionality in the Coq proof assistant, allowing them to formally verify properties like causality and provide certified contract analyses and transformations. Their approach demonstrates how techniques from programming language theory and formal verification can be applied to increase trust and reliability in financial contract management software. The use of symbolic techniques, rather than purely numeric ones, opens up new possibilities for contract analysis.

* MTL ACTUS in Lean 4
Lean4 serves as our implementation language for the project. Lean4 [cite:@Moura2021TheL4] is a modern, open-source theorem prover and programming language that combines powerful automated reasoning with an expressive type system. Developed by Microsoft Research and the Lean community, it excels in mathematical formalization and formal verification. For our work on financial contracts, Lean4's strong type system and ability to handle complex logical statements make it ideal for implementing and reasoning about MTL specifications. Its syntax, designed to be close to mathematical notation, allows us to clearly express and verify our MTL formalization of financial contracts.

** Money and time
Unlike ACTUS, we consider the hard part of time to be a presentational step taken later, and content ourselves with something like Unix Time [cite:@UnixTimeWiki] (a newtype of whole numbers). We do something similar with money.

** Metric temporal logic
Temporal logic [cite:@Pnueli1977LTL] is widely used in model checking to verify reactive systems [cite:@Baier2008PrinciplesModelChecking]. MTL is an extension of temporal logic that incorporates quantitative time constraints. It allows for the specification of time-bound properties in real-time systems, making it particularly useful for describing and verifying time-sensitive behaviors. MTL formulas can express properties such as "event A must occur within 5 time units of event B" or "condition C must hold for at least 10 time units." This makes MTL well-suited for modeling and analyzing systems where precise timing is crucial, such as financial contracts with specific execution deadlines or duration-based clauses.

inductive Proposition (T : Type) : Type where
| tru : Proposition T
| atom : T -> Proposition T
| negate : Proposition T -> Proposition T
| conjunct : Proposition T -> Proposition T -> Proposition T
| until : Proposition T -> Window -> Proposition T -> Proposition T
| since : Proposition T -> Window -> Proposition T -> Proposition T

With ~disjunct~ derived from ~negate~ and ~conjunct~, and the unary temporal operators given in the usual way as combinations of the binary temporal operators ~since~ ($S$) and ~until~ ($U$) with ~tru~ (the value true $T$). In particular, ~eventually~ ($\Diamond_w \phi$) is given $\top U_w \phi$ and ~always~ ($\Box_w \phi$) is given $\neg \Diamond_w \neg \phi$. We additionally have the temporal operator ~next~ ($\circ_w \phi$) from $(\neg \top) U_w \phi$, saying that $\phi$ is in the subsequent timestamp. In this MTL, indexing an operator with the window ~(Timestamp.infinity, Timestamp.infinity)~ means a degenerate case where the temporal operator simplifies to a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) operator.

I use Lean's notations feature to make these operators easier to construct.

** Automata
In the context of MTL, automata play a crucial role in both theoretical analysis and practical applications. Timed automata, in particular, are closely related to MTL as they provide a way to model and verify real-time systems with quantitative timing constraints.

The relationship between MTL and automata is significant for several reasons:
1. Decidability and complexity: Automata-based techniques are often used to establish decidability results and complexity bounds for various fragments of MTL.
2. Model checking: Timed automata can be used as an operational model against which MTL specifications can be verified, enabling efficient model checking algorithms.
3. Expressiveness: The expressive power of different MTL fragments can be characterized by corresponding classes of timed automata, providing insights into the logic's capabilities.
4. Synthesis: Automata-theoretic approaches can be employed to synthesize controllers or implementations that satisfy given MTL specifications.

This connection between MTL and automata provides powerful tools for analyzing and implementing time-constrained systems, including financial contracts with precise temporal requirements.

  transitions : List (Transition Alphabet)
  acceptingStates : Lean.HashSet State
#+END_SRC
The timed finite automata (TFA) type is defined in the usual way, where a guarded and labeled transition is better represented as a struct than a function.
** Contracts
A contract consists of a type for the terms that the counterparties agree to and a type of events. With that, you give a /contract/ as an MTL formula (or spec) along with it's corresponding automaton.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean4
structure ActusContract where
  terms : Type
  event : Type
  event_atomicprop : AtomicProp event
  contract : terms -> Proposition event
  automaton : terms -> TFA event
#+END_SRC
*** ~PAM~
We show the schema in proof of concept for Principal at Maturity (PAM). A PAM is a loan with periodic interest payments, but the principal is not paid at all until the maturity date, which closes the contract.
#+BEGIN_SRC lean4
-- payment interval assumed to be 1
structure Terms where
  principal : Money
  interest_rate : Timestamp -> Scalar -- fixed rate as constant function
  start_date : Timestamp
  maturity : TimeDelta

inductive Event :=
| Maturity : Event
| PrincipalRepayment : Event
| InterestPayment : Event
  deriving BEq, Hashable, Repr, DecidableEq

def Contract := Proposition Event deriving BEq, Hashable, Repr
#+END_SRC

A modest safety property is that it is not maturity date until at least one interest payment.
$$
S := (\neg \texttt{Maturity}) U_{cl} \texttt{InterestPayment}
$$
Where $cl$ represents the time window of the whole contract length, ~(start_date, start_date + maturity)~.

Another important factor if we're going to capture PAM behavior in the spec is that interest payments are continuous until maturity
$$
C := \Box_{cl} (\texttt{Maturity} \to (\circ_{cl} (\texttt{InterestPayment} \lor \texttt{PrincipalRepayment}))) U_{cl} \texttt{Maturity}
$$

So our /contract specification/ for PAM can be written
$$
S \land C
$$
Which looks and lean4 precisely as
#+BEGIN_SRC lean4
def safety (terms : Terms) : Contract :=
  let cl := contract_length terms;
  (~ [[Event.Maturity]]) U [[Event.InterestPayment]] in cl

def ip_continuous_till_mat (terms : Terms) : Contract :=
  let cl := contract_length terms;
  {\Box cl} ([[Event.InterestPayment]] implies
      ({◯ cl.incr_start {dt := 1}}
        ([[Event.InterestPayment]]
        or [[Event.PrincipalRepayment]])
      )
    )
    U [[Event.Maturity]] in cl

def contract (terms : Terms) : Contract :=
    ip_continuous_till_mat terms and safety terms
#+END_SRC

Omitted here for brevity is the PAM TFA template.
** TODO show the eval of the automaton agreeing with the spec.
* Future work
** Compiling general timed finite automata from MTL specs
The algorithm to generate the automaton that corresponds to a given MTL spec is known, but we have not implemented it in the current work.
** Implementing the remaining ACTUS taxonomy
There is a folk wisdom among ACTUS circles that PAM is 80% of the work. However, it still remains for us to implement the other 30something contracts in the ACTUS taxonomy.
** Assume-guarantee contracts
Another obvious approach to finance would be assume-guarantee contracts [cite:@Girard2022AssumeGuaranteeInvariant] [cite:@Saoud2021AssumeGuaranteeContinuous]. A rough sketch of what this would look like would be showing invariants not as temporal logic specs but as contracts with preconditions and postconditions.
** Lustre and Kind2
A promising direction for future work is the implementation of ACTUS using the Lustre programming language [cite:@Halbwachs1992Lustre], with verification via the Kind2 tool [cite:@Champion2016Kind2]. This approach could significantly advance formal methods in financial contract modeling and verification.

Lustre is a synchronous dataflow programming language designed for reactive systems that require real-time execution and high reliability. Originally developed for critical systems in domains like avionics and automotive control, Lustre's paradigm aligns well with the state-machine nature of ACTUS contracts. Of particular interest is Iowa Lustre, an extended version of the language that offers enhanced expressiveness through features like array support and an improved type system.

Kind2 is a powerful, open-source formal verification tool specifically designed for Lustre programs. It combines various model checking techniques to verify safety properties of synchronous systems. The synergy between Lustre and Kind2 provides a robust framework for developing and verifying critical reactive systems.
In the context of financial contracts, we envision the following steps:

1. ACTUS in Lustre: Implement the core ACTUS contract types as Lustre modules. Each contract type would be represented as a synchronous dataflow program, with its state transitions and temporal behaviors explicitly modeled.
2. Formal Specification: Express contract properties, regulatory requirements, and desired behaviors as formal specifications in Lustre's assertion language.
3. Verification with Kind2: Utilize Kind2 to formally verify the Lustre implementation against these specifications. This could include proving the absence of certain types of errors, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and verifying key properties of contract behavior.
4. Composition and Scalability: Leverage Lustre's modularity to compose complex financial instruments from simpler components, and investigate the scalability of this approach to large-scale financial systems.
5. Real-time Analysis: Exploit Lustre's real-time capabilities to model and analyze time-critical aspects of financial contracts, such as payment deadlines or market-responsive behaviors.

This approach could yield several benefits:

A formally verified implementation of ACTUS, potentially increasing trust and reliability in financial contract systems.
New methodologies for designing and analyzing financial contracts using formal methods.
Improved tools for regulatory compliance and risk assessment in the financial sector.
A bridge between the financial modeling and formal methods communities, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Challenges to address would include managing the learning curve for financial experts unfamiliar with Lustre, and potentially extending Lustre or developing domain-specific libraries to fully capture complex financial concepts.
By pursuing this direction, we aim to further advance the application of formal methods to financial contracts, potentially leading to more robust, verifiable, and transparent financial systems.
* Conclusion
In this paper, we have taken a preliminary step towards addressing two persistent challenges in financial technology: the risk of code bugs in contract execution and the increasing complexity of financial instruments. While the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS) previously attempted to address these issues by modeling financial interactions as composable state machines, we recognized the potential for further improvement.

Our contribution lies in exploring the application of MTL to financial contract specification. Using a Principal at Maturity (PAM) loan as a simple yet illustrative example, we have demonstrated how MTL can be used to express contract terms and behaviors. We implemented this approach using the Lean prover, providing a proof of concept for representing financial contracts as MTL specifications.

This work represents an initial exploration rather than a comprehensive solution. By treating a financial contract as an MTL specification, we aim to provide a foundation for more rigorous verification and potentially improved interpretability. However, we acknowledge that significant work remains to be done to fully realize these benefits and to extend this approach to more complex financial instruments.

Our implementation of MTL in Lean, while functional for our example, is limited in scope and would require substantial expansion to handle a wider range of financial contracts. Moreover, the practical implications of this approach for the financial industry remain to be fully explored and validated.
Looking ahead, this work opens up several avenues for future research. These include extending the MTL framework to cover a broader range of financial instruments, investigating the scalability of this approach to more complex financial ecosystems, and exploring how this method might integrate with existing financial systems and regulatory frameworks.

In conclusion, while our work on applying MTL to financial contracts shows promise, it is best viewed as a starting point for further research rather than a fully developed solution. We hope that this initial exploration will stimulate further discussion and investigation at the intersection of formal methods and financial technology, potentially contributing to the development of more reliable and interpretable financial systems in the future.
