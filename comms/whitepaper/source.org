A financial contract is an interaction between people involving money. It is bad when there are bugs in the code executing these interactions. Additionally, it's not great when the interactions become too complicated to understand. Previously, the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS) [cite:@Brammertz2019SmartCD] attempted to tackle this twin problem by rendering interactions as atomic state machines that compose together. In this paper, we take a natural next step to metric temporal logic (MTL) and take a contract to be an MTL /specification/, showing the proof of concept on the principal at maturity loan (PAM). Along the way, we implement MTL in the Lean prover. The code is available at the https url https://github.com/cspr-rad/mtl-actus.

* Introduction
Financial contracts, at their core, are interactions between people involving money. However, the execution of these interactions is increasingly reliant on code, which introduces the risk of bugs - a problem that has led to significant financial losses. Moreover, as financial instruments become more exotic, they often become too complex to interpret easily, further complicating the situation.

The Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS) was an attempt to address this dual challenge. It aimed to simplify financial interactions by representing them as atomic state machines that could be composed together. However, this approach, while innovative, had its limitations.

We propose a step forward by leveraging ideas from the field of model checking. Specifically, we suggest using metric temporal logic (MTL) as a foundation for defining financial contracts. In this framework, a contract becomes an MTL specification. This approach offers two key advantages: firstly, MTL specifications can serve as an interpretable grounding for even the most complex financial instruments. Secondly, contracts can be rigorously checked to ensure they comply with these MTL specifications.
This methodology has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and interpretability of financial contracts, addressing the core issues that have plagued the industry.
** Problem statement
ACTUS makes tremendous steps forward in the goal of verifiable financial contracts. However, it's current iteration falls short in a few ways. Lorem ipsum
** Contributions
The current paper shows in principle how to model finance as a reactive system for the purposes of formal verification, on an example Principal at Maturity (PAM) contract.

1. Reactive System Approach: We demonstrate how financial contracts can be modeled as reactive systems, a paradigm commonly used in computer science for systems that maintain ongoing interactions with their environment. This novel perspective allows us to apply well-established formal verification techniques from the realm of reactive systems to financial contracts.
2. Formal Verification Framework: We introduce a framework for the formal verification of financial contracts. This approach enables rigorous mathematical proof of contract properties, potentially reducing errors and ambiguities in contract execution.
3. Principal at Maturity (PAM) Case Study: To illustrate our methodology, we provide a detailed case study of a Principal at Maturity (PAM) contract. This common financial instrument serves as an accessible yet meaningful example to showcase the power and applicability of our approach.
4. Temporal Logic Specification: We demonstrate how to express financial contract terms and conditions using metric temporal logic (MTL). This formal language allows for precise and unambiguous specification of time-dependent behaviors, which are crucial in financial contracts.

** Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard
In [cite:@Brammertz2019SmartCD], the ACTUS (Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard) introduces a formalized approach to representing financial contracts using concepts from state machine theory. Developed by the ACTUS Financial Research Foundation, this framework models financial instruments as algorithmic contracts with well-defined states, events, and transition functions.

A key contribution of ACTUS is its event-based architecture for financial modeling. Each contract type is defined by a set of state variables and a series of event types. These events trigger state transitions and cash flows according to precisely specified functions. This approach allows for a representation of financial contracts over their lifecycle, enabling accurate projection of future states and cash flows.

ACTUS formalizes the temporal aspects of financial contracts through standardized scheduling functions and date adjustment conventions. This allows for precise modeling of complex temporal patterns in financial agreements, such as irregular payment schedules or conditional events.

By applying state machine concepts to finance, ACTUS provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for representing and analyzing financial contracts. This standardization facilitates more precise financial modeling, risk assessment, and regulatory analysis across a wide range of financial instruments.

** Algebraic and Inductively Defined Financial Interaction
[cite:@Jones2000ComposingCA] defined an algebra for contracts of two parties. In [cite:@Bahr2015CertifiedSM] a contract for more than two parties can be well-typed. This line of work is an alternative solution to the ACTUS-like solution, namely the typechecker, to a very similar problem set around correctness and interpretability of finance.

The seminal work on formalizing financial contracts using functional programming techniques was done by [cite:@Jones2000ComposingCA]. They introduced a combinator library for describing contracts declaratively, along with a compositional denotational semantics for valuing contracts. Their approach allowed complex contracts to be built up from simpler components in a modular way. Importantly, they separated the abstract specification of contracts from the concrete implementation details of valuation. This allowed different valuation models and numerical methods to be used without changing the contract descriptions.

Building on this foundation, [cite:@Bahr2015CertifiedSM] developed a certified symbolic management system for multi-party financial contracts. They extended the contract language to handle multiple parties and added a formal cash-flow semantics. Crucially, they implemented the contract language and management functionality in the Coq proof assistant, allowing them to formally verify properties like causality and provide certified contract analyses and transformations. Their approach demonstrates how techniques from programming language theory and formal verification can be applied to increase trust and reliability in financial contract management software. The use of symbolic techniques, rather than purely numeric ones, opens up new possibilities for contract analysis.

* (body) Problem statement (Avi)
* (body) (Code from the codebase)
Unlike ACTUS, we consider the hard part of time to be a presentational step taken later, and content ourselves with something like Unix Time (a newtype of whole numbers). We do something similar with money.
* Future work
** Implementing the remaining ACTUS taxonomy
There is a folk wisdom among ACTUS circles that PAM is 80% of the work. However, it still remains for us to implement the other 30something contracts in the ACTUS taxonomy.
** Lustre and Kind2
A promising direction for future work is the implementation of ACTUS using the Lustre programming language, with verification via the Kind2 tool. This approach could significantly advance formal methods in financial contract modeling and verification.

Lustre is a synchronous dataflow programming language designed for reactive systems that require real-time execution and high reliability. Originally developed for critical systems in domains like avionics and automotive control, Lustre's paradigm aligns well with the state-machine nature of ACTUS contracts. Of particular interest is Iowa Lustre, an extended version of the language that offers enhanced expressiveness through features like array support and an improved type system.

Kind2 is a powerful, open-source formal verification tool specifically designed for Lustre programs. It combines various model checking techniques to verify safety properties of synchronous systems. The synergy between Lustre and Kind2 provides a robust framework for developing and verifying critical reactive systems.
In the context of financial contracts, we envision the following steps:

1. ACTUS in Lustre: Implement the core ACTUS contract types as Lustre modules. Each contract type would be represented as a synchronous dataflow program, with its state transitions and temporal behaviors explicitly modeled.
2. Formal Specification: Express contract properties, regulatory requirements, and desired behaviors as formal specifications in Lustre's assertion language.
3. Verification with Kind2: Utilize Kind2 to formally verify the Lustre implementation against these specifications. This could include proving the absence of certain types of errors, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and verifying key properties of contract behavior.
4. Composition and Scalability: Leverage Lustre's modularity to compose complex financial instruments from simpler components, and investigate the scalability of this approach to large-scale financial systems.
5. Real-time Analysis: Exploit Lustre's real-time capabilities to model and analyze time-critical aspects of financial contracts, such as payment deadlines or market-responsive behaviors.

This approach could yield several benefits:

A formally verified implementation of ACTUS, potentially increasing trust and reliability in financial contract systems.
New methodologies for designing and analyzing financial contracts using formal methods.
Improved tools for regulatory compliance and risk assessment in the financial sector.
A bridge between the financial modeling and formal methods communities, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Challenges to address would include managing the learning curve for financial experts unfamiliar with Lustre, and potentially extending Lustre or developing domain-specific libraries to fully capture complex financial concepts.
By pursuing this direction, we aim to further advance the application of formal methods to financial contracts, potentially leading to more robust, verifiable, and transparent financial systems.
